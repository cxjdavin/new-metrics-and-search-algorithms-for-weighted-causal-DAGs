# New metrics and search algorithms for weighted causal DAGs

This is the accompanying repository the "New metrics and search algorithms for weighted causal DAGs" paper. It is available at **coming soon**.

Our experiments follow the setup of https://github.com/csquires/dct-policy (the accompanying repository of [SMG+20]) and https://github.com/cxjdavin/subset-verification-and-search-algorithms-for-causal-DAGs (the accompanying repository of [CSB22]).
